ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @waldir-nunez
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data visualization, with a focus on transforming complex datasets into clear, insightful visual narratives through innovative web programming techniques.
ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently studying a master's in Data Science and AI at the University of Liverpool, where I'm focused on machine learning modeling and evaluation.
ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at waldirdesu@gmail.com
âš¡ Fun fact: I was born in Mexico and have lived in Thailand and Japan, which has made me fluent in Spanish, Thai, and Japanese.
